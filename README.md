# CarRentalSystem
 A gui made using java event handling and swing.
 Nitj car rental is yet
another learning time
project developed in Java,
the idea about it came
when we see there is a lot
of transport problem in
Nitj as it is very far from
the city.
What it does is, it simply
takes the user's details
and the car that the user
is booking.
With time we add more
features to this project to
provide more userfriendly interfaces.
# Project Highlights
1. GUI is simple and userfriendly.
